## Purpose
The problem we are trying to solve is assisting the Government with distributing information about significant health concerns to the public in a quick and easy manner. The app addresses this issue by providing a central platform for people to get information on COVID-19 symptoms, testing centres and live updates. By providing this service the government would be able to control the spread of COVID-19 and other possible infectious diseases. 

## Functionality
The functionalities of the 'COVID-19 Care' app is to provide: 
* Advice on how to stay safe during COVID-19 
* A checklist of symptoms 
* Search for testing sites in Victoria
* Live updates on COVID-19 from Government Twitter accounts

By using PowerApps, it is also feasible for our company to use as it will be run on PowerApps. Not only does this platform provide us with an efficient way of creating this app, but we can also easily distribute and work with a company to help improve our services.

## Target Audience
As COVID-19 is affecting everyone in the community, 'COVID-19 Care' app will provide its services to all types of users. Users from different age groups would easily be able to navigate around the app and find the relevant information suitable for their needs. Moreover, via the app, health care workers and large organisations will be able to productively use their time wisely whilst also providing information to their patients, visitors and society about important information on COVID-19 in a fast and accurate manner. Patients and workers will be able to obtain information simply by following the easy navigations within the app. Users with poor eyesight will also be able to zoom in within the apps to allow them to read information better. By providing this service, the whole community will be able to take advantage of this new app as society is now more reliant on mobile phones. With mobile phones constantly being in people's presents, users are able to find information about COVID-19 in a fast manner and will be available for all users. Further, with out app being available on Google Play store and App Store, users can input feedback for the app to further review and improve on in the future. For those who habe a disability and have difficulty using a phone, improvements will be made in the future to cater for these needs. 



## Future Roadmap
With the COVID-19 app being relatively new, we are further aiming to add and improve:

- translator to the app
- gps navigation to testing sites
- alerts of hotspot areas
- live notifications of COVID-19

Through the improvements placed towards the app, it will become more efficient to use and target users who are from a non-English background. 


## Conclusion
As a result of this app, the spread of COVID-19 will reduce and release information about the pandemic to more audiences as compared to the current government strategy. COVID-19 Care is suitable for all users and will be considering user feedback to provide a better service to its audiences.
